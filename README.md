# Panteon Technical Case


Hello everyone! </br>
This is my 1 weekly journey and all this time I tried to post comments whenever I change the project, here is the result. </br>
I hope you like it.



# Game Semantics


  Gameplay of this game is very simple: </br>
  - Your goal is to passing all the obstacles and painting the wall on the final platform. </br>
  - You can press the (D) key to go right, and the (A) key to go left. </br>
  - Be careful, if you fall down, you will start the game again from the starting point.</br>
  
 
# Game Development Process


  I used some interfaces for the player and the opponents. </br>

  I've used Singleton Pattern for the player part and Observer Pattern for the wall painting.</br>
