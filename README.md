# PanteonCase


Hello dear panteon developer. This project is my 1 week journey, all this time i tried to post comments whenever i change the project and here is the result. I hope you like it.



# HOW TO PLAY GAME 


  Gameplay of this game is very simple. 
  Your goal is to pass all the obstacles and paint the wall on the final platform. 
  You can press the (D) key to go right, and the (A) key to go left. 
  And be careful, if you fall down, you will start the game again from the starting point.
  
 
# Game Development Process


  I used some interface for player and opponents. 
  
  For player i used singleton pattern and for painting to wall i used observer pattern.
 
  I wrote and applied a player ranking system algorithm to the project.
  
  And i also used Scriptable Object for AI diffulty.
